## Project Overview
The project is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree and [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) is the starter code. It is provided some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I have to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file, as only the shuffle cards function is provided. I have included sound and cards animations.

## How to play
There are 16 cards on a deck, click on the cards to reveal icons and see if you find a match.

If the cards match, they will remain open. If they don't match, they will flip over. Try again until you find the 8 matches.

You can play [here](https://lucia-gm.github.io/memory-game/).

## Rating
The rating is base on the number of moves made to complete the game:
- Less than 16 moves, you will receive a 3 stars.
- Between 16 and 25, you will receive a 2 stars.
- More than 25, you will receive a 1 stars.
